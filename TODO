* When it open the one-wire sensor for data, it should not close the application upon open-error or read-error, but instead in a loop try to re-open it after a small paus.
For example:

try open, 
if fail -> paus 5 secs.
Try open, -> paus 5 secs,
	if fail (close heater,) and retry open for ever with 5 secs paus.
